"Climate change refers to significant, long-term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. These activities increase greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere, leading to global warming. The impacts of climate change include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, disruptions to ecosystems, and threats to biodiversity. Scientists emphasize the urgent need for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, transitioning to renewable energy sources, and adopting sustainable practices to mitigate the worst effects of climate change ","Sure, here's a summary of the text in 3 simple bullet points:

- Climate change is caused by human activities, mainly the burning of fossil fuels.


- Greenhouse gas emissions increase the earth's temperature and lead to global warming.


- Climate change has several negative impacts, including rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and threats to biodiversity.",2025-07-05 22:34:33.156046
